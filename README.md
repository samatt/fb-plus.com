# fb-plussss

This project is currently split (for no good reason other than thats how it happened) between for Repositories

-   `fb-plussss` is the current repository. It contains the code for the website
-   [fb-plus-api](https://github.com/samatt/fb-plus-api) is the server that talks to our mongoDb. The website and the extension both pull data from the server.
-   The server also has [docs](https://api.fbplussss.com/api-docs). In case you want to see what the calls are. If you want to try them in your browser use `https://api.fbplussss.com` as the URL instead of `localhost:8080` as stated in the docs. Ill fix that at somepoint
-   [fb-plus-collector](https://github.com/samatt/fb-plus-collector)
